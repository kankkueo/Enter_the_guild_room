time combat. Theme is yet to be decided.



### 2.11.2023

agenda until next meeting
Valtteri will make a data structure to represent a room and
implement collision detection.

Johannes will initialize a structure for the project 
and create the first classes.

Once a simple class structure has been created
more features can be implemented.

The next meeting is scheduled on wednesday 8.11.

Today we created a renderer class and added some assets.
We also improved the project structure.

Johannes made character models and animations.

Up next:

Elmo will implement proper input handling.

Valtteri will continue working on collision detection
and create a main menu.

Ville will create classes for different types of entities.

Johannes will continue making assets.

### 14.11.2023

Inputs are now implemented. Room rendering
works. Player Monster, room and item classes were added.

Agenda:

Room wall collisions

Projectiles for weapons and hit detection

Monsters implementation

The goal is to achieve a game state where a room has a single
monster and a player. The player should be able to damage the monster.

### 24.11.2023

Currently the game has functional monsters which take damage
and die. They do not deal damage to the player at the moment, but
they follow the player around. Room transitions after clearing work.
The player has different models for walking direction.

Agenda for next week:

Rotating textures for weapon model.

Heads up display to show player stats.
