 This is a rogue-\/like dungeon crawler top-\/down shooter written in c++. In the game, the player has to get through a set of randomized rooms with increasingly difficult random monsters with random weapons until they reach the final boss. Defeating the boss ends the game. The game is reset upon player death.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Build instructions}{Build instructions}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
